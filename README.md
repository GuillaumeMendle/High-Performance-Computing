# High-Performance-Computing (C++)

C++ program implemented for a High-Performance Computing project at Imperial College.

Parallel numerical code for simulating heat transfer in a plate by solving the heat conduction equation numerically using the finite element method.

3 cases are implemented (see "initial_conditions" file for more details).

Folder "case_3_results" contains the numerical simulations of case 3 for a parallel and a non-parallel C++ code as well as the solution implemented in Python by the lecturers.


# Research Project (MATLAB)

Matlab programs implemented for the MSc research project: "3D Dam-break flow computation in the presence of an obstacle". 

"dam_break_2D_hump" and "dam_break_3D_hump" simulate a dam-break flow over a hump respectively in 2 and 3 dimensions. 

"dam_break_shapes" simulates the top view of a gravitational spreading (possibility to simulate other initial shapes such as cylinder or cross by uncommenting the program). 

You will also find videos of different simulations related to the above-mentioned programs (folder "Videos")
