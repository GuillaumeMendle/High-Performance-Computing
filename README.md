# High-Performance-Computing (C++)

C++ program implemented for a High-Performance Computing project at Imperial College.

Parallel numerical code for simulating heat transfer in a plate by solving the heat conduction equation numerically using the finite element method.

3 cases are implemented (see "cases_table" and "plate_drawing" files for more details).

# Research Project (MATLAB)

Matlab programs implemented for Dam-Break flow computation (MSc research project)

"dam_break_2D_hump" and "dam_break_3D_hump" simulate a dam-break flow over a hump respectively in 2 and 3 dimensions. 

"dam_break_shapes" simulates the top view of a gravitational spreading (possibility to simulate other shapes such as cylinder or cross,
by uncommenting the program). 

You will also find videos of different simulations related to the above-mentioned programs.
